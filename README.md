## Process and challenges

Besides my health issues, the hardest part of the assignment was getting used to Bootstrap. I was stuck on the navbar for far too long, as I wanted it to extend the full legnth of the page, but I found it hard to do this using Bootstrap. 

I decided to keep the navigation as it, and move on to building the rest of the website.

Sometimes it's better to choose functionality over the design you initially started with.
