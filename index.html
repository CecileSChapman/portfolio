        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to my portfolio website</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cecile and I'm a college student with a passion for web design and development. I've always been fascinated by the way websites can be both functional and visually stunning, and I'm constantly seeking to improve my skills in both areas.
            <br>
            On this website, you'll find a showcase of some of my recent work, as well as information about my background and interests. I'm excited about the prospect of pursuing a career in this dynamic field and I'm eager to connect with others who share my enthusiasm. Thank you for visiting!
